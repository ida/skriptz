Note: This is an ESM (import method), if used in CJS (require-method),
      it needs to be imported within an asynchronous function:

      (async () => {
          
          const filterConsole = await import('filter-console')
      
      })();


chokidar -> listen to add/change/delete-events of all files of a directory

@supercharge/request-ip -> get client ip-address

fs-extra -> extend and optimze fs-module



not tested:

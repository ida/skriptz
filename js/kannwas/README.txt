Insert two children ot the body-element: A canvas and a cursor.
Body and children are positioned absolutely, cursor stays at
initial position (in the center of body, which is here our viewport)
and canvas moves when user hits arrow-keys.

When cursor hits a certain position in the cnavas, visualize that and
trigger an action, if user hits enter-key.

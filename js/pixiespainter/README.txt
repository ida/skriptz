What
----

A paint-app which allows to draw, using the keyboard only.


Why
---

When I tried to show a three-year old how to paint with an app, it turned out
that simultaneously holding the mouse-button pressed down and move the whole
animal around at the same time, was a little bit of too much of a challenge,
so I thought of a way how painting digitally could be possible without having
to use a mouse.

And because I'm a keyboard-fetishist, so as usual also because of egoistically
intrinsicated motivation.

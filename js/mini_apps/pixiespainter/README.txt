What
----

A paint-app which allows to draw, using the keyboard only.


Why
---

When I tried to show a three-year old how to paint with an app, it turned out
that simultaneously holding the mouse-button pressed down and move the whole
animal around at the same time, was a little bit of too much of a challenge,
so I thought of a way how painting digitally could be possible without having
to use a mouse.

And because I'm a keyboard-fetishist, so as usual also because of egoistically
intrinsicated motivation.


How
---

Download this folder and open the 'index.html'-file in a browser.

The controller can be used for moving the brush and also shows the keyboard-equivalents.
Click "on", respectively "off" to turn the brush on and off.
Click the color-picker inside of controls to change the brush-color.
Currently you can change the size of the brush, clicking on plus and minus.
The other two parameters are not yet hooked up, to be done.

Browser-based spreadsheet
=========================


What
----

- Shows your browser's local storage in a spreadsheet.

- Let's you modify it on the fly, like in commonly known spreadsheet-desktop-apps.

- Stores any modification in realtime: Close browser, come back anytime, data is still there.

- Optimized for comfortable keyboard-navigation, via tab- and arrow-keys.


Why
---

- Do not accidentally loose precious user-input.

- Perspectively use it for working in offline-mode and sync with browser-external data-storage.


How
---

Ever used a spreadsheet-app, like Excel or LibreOffice's equivalent?

Yes: You'll find your way.

No: You'll find your way.


TODO
----

- Escape commas of cell-values.

- Provide im- and export-possibilitites in CSV-format.


Futurama
--------

- Instead of using a local-strorage's key as column-header and the paired value as a sequence of comma-separated values, consider to use only one key-value-pair, where the key is a most possible unique identifier and its value holds the whole data in json-format.

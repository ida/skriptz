    wget rawgit.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/master/apt-cyg

    install apt-cyg /bin

    apt-cyg update

# ZIP is not installed on Windows

    wget https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z2201-x64.exe

# Then doubleclick file and an installation-window opens.

# Now close (cygwin)terminal and restart it!

    apt-cyg install zip
    apt-cyg install unzip


# Similar to the 'build-essentials'-bundle for linux:

    apt-cyg install make gcc-core gcc-g++ patch bzip2 perl tar xz

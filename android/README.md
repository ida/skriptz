Create and build an Android app from the commandline like this:

    bash main.sh app-name


Most of the scripts in this directory base upon the excellent article
"Building an Android App from the Command Line" from Hans Wennborg:

https://www.hanshq.net/command-line-android.html

Which should be consulted again, in case we need to install Java and JDK
from sources or want to use C-scripts in our app.
